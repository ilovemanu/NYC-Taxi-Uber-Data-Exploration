# NYC-Taxi-Uber-Data-Exploration

In this oroject we combined NYC taxi/uber data with NYC local basketball game data and carried out the following analyses:
- Spatial plotting to visualize pre- and post-game fans' pickup and dropoff locations.
- Post-game taxi tipping patterns.

The complete story is described in the pdf file. Code implementation can be found in NYC_taxi_uber_project.ipynb. Data source can be found within the notebook.
